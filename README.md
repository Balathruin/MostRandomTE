# How to use

1. Download the repository by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP.
2. Extract the archive.
3. Currently there are only debug builds! Open `cmake-build-debug`.
4. Make sure you don't already have a `TERandomized.nfsms` file in the folder. If you do, rename, move or delete it, otherwise you cannot generate a new script.
5. Start `MostRandomTE.exe` to generate your randomizer script.
6. Back up your game files, primarily the GLOBAL folder! There is no uninstaller for the randomizer.
7. Import TERandomized.nfsms in VltEd or OGVI and save.
